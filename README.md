# Detection-of-Potholes-Using-Smartphone-Sensors
SP19: ADV MOBILITY &amp; CLOUD COMPUTING: 23627 

**Abstract**

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application to monitor potholes, they may cause severe damage to vehicles and lead to major accidents, In USA, they stand in 18th position in causing accidents. Keeping road safety in mind and acknowledging wide usage of smartphones, we proposed a real time monitoring system using smartphone sensors and machine learning algorithms, which detects and logs potholes data to AWS server.
